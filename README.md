FEED READER PROJECT

1. About the project:

The objective of the FEND Feed Reader testing project was to learn and demonstrate how to implement a testing program such as “Jasmine” for JavaScript functions.For this class we are to use Jasmine which is an open source program and behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code.

 

2. Installation:

Installation is not needed. User should download the file or fork the file from Github and open the 'index' file.

 

3. About tests?

The test could be divided into six category

 

Test #1 – RSS Feeds

The first test involved "allFeeds variable" in the app.js file. It is important that the feed is not empty of data and were properly defined.

Test #2 - URL in the deed

This is to ensures that allFeeds array has specific url defined that was provided with the title of each feed. This was done using a loop function over each individual feed.

 

Test #3 – name defined

This also involved using loop function over individual feed in the allFeeds array to ensure that they are well defined

 

Test #4 – Menu Element

The menu suppose to be hidden by default and should show up and hide after ‘click’.

This part required a new test suite using “the menu” element.

 

Test #5 – Initial Entries

This test is to ensure that loadFeed function completed the action. Completed Work (Initial Entries) Required to write a new test suite with an "initial entries" variable. The loadFeed function was asynchronous and utilized a beforeEach function with done(); at the end.

 

Test #6 New Feed Selection Required to write one last test suite with "new feed selection" variable. This test was to make sure that if the news feed content changed within the array that the loadFeed function would activate the change to show the new data content.
